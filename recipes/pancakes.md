# Pancakes

#recipe #sweet #easter #pudding

-----

**Preparation time:** 5 minutes
**Cooking time:** a few seconds per pancake 

Makes approx. 6-8 pancakes 

## Ingredients 

- 110g flour 
- 200ml semi-skimmed milk
- 2 eggs
- oil or butter

## Method

1. combine the flour, milk and eggs in a jug using a whisk 
1. preheat oil/butter in a frying pan 
1. pour a little of the batter into the pan
1. wait for it to go golden brown on one side, then flip and cook the other side
1. repeat until you run out of batter  

Serve with toppings of your choice.  My personal favourite is sugar and lemon juice.

## Tips

- Heat a plate before you start and use it to keep the pancakes warm as you're cooking them
- Allow enough batter for 1 or 2 wasted pancakes (the first one is always too oily!)
