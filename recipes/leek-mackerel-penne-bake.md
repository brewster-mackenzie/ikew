This is a super-fast, filling meal for busy midweek winter nights - it's great with smoked haddock too

**Preparation time:** 10 mins

**Cooking time:** 20 mins

## Ingredients


- 2 leeks, trimmed, washed and sliced
- knob of butter
- 175g penne
- 200ml pot reduced-fat crème fraîche
- 1 tbsp capers
- 2 small smoked mackerel fillets, skinned and flesh flaked into large chunks
- 25g breadcrumb


## Method

Fry the leeks in the butter until very soft, about 10-15 mins. Meanwhile, boil the pasta and heat the grill. When the leeks are soft, stir in the crème fraîche, capers and fish. Heat through for 1 min. Drain the pasta and stir into the sauce, season to taste, then tip everything into a small baking dish. Scatter with the crumbs and grill until golden and crisp.
