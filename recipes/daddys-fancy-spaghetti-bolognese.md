# Daddy's fancy spaghetti Bolognese

A simple yet tasty Bolognese sauce (sort of) that went down well with Felix.  Allow a long time to reduce the sauce down.  The trick is to finely chop the vegetables and garlic.

**Preparation Time:** 30m
**Cooking Time:** 2hrs

## Ingredients

- 1lb minced beef
- 1 large onion, finely chopped
- 1 or 2 carrots, finely chopped
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 2 tins tomatoes
- 2 tbsp tomato puree
- 2 tbsp mixed Italian herbs
- 1 bay leaf
- 500ml beef stock (use 2 cubes)
- 500ml red wine
- 2 tsp granulated sugar
- salt & pepper
- chili flakes (optional)

## Method

1. blend the tomatoes, puree, mixed herbs, sugar and a pinch of salt together in a jug using a hand blender
2. fry the garlic and onions over a medium heat until the onions turn clear
3. add the mince and carrots, cook until the mince just starts to brown
4. add the tomatoes, ⅔ of the stock, ⅔ of the wine and the bay leaf, mix well
5. bring to a simmer and leave to reduce down
6. after a while add the remaining stock and wine, reduce further until it becomes thick and rich in colour
7. season to taste
8. serve on spaghetti with grated Parmesan and garlic bread
