# Onion gravy

A recipe for a simple, yet delicious, onion gravy.  Perfect with sausage & mash.

# Ingredients

- 25g butter
- 3 red onions & 1 white onion, halved and sliced
- 500ml beef stock
- 200ml red wine
- 1 tbsp red wine vinegar (or balsamic)
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp flour
- salt
- several sprigs of thyme
- 1 bay leaf

# Method

- Melt the butter in a large pan over a medium heat
- Add the thyme and bay leaf and cook for 1 minute to begin releasing the flavours
- Add the sliced onions, sugar and a pinch of salt
- Cook the onions until they start to become sticky and caramelised
- Add the flour and stir well to coat the onions
- Pour in the wine and vinegar, continue stirring to prevent the flour from forming lumps
- Gradually add the stock until the consistency is a little thinner than you would like 
- Continue to stir for about 5 minutes until you achieve the desired consistency.  I like just thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.
