A recipe for banana cupcakes.  I used this recipe for Scrunch's 1st birthday in 2024. 
Serve with icing as per the original recipe or use a topping of your choice.  I used my favourite [[cream-cheese-frosting]].

## Ingredients

- 2 very ripe bananas
- 140g caster sugar
- 55g unsalted butter
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 tbsp semi-skimmed milk
- 225g self-raising flour
- 1 tsp baking powder

## Method

- pre-heat oven to 170C (150C fan/gas mark 3)
- line a muffin tin with 12 cupcake cases    
- mash the bananas in a large bowl
- add the butter and sugar, stir until combined
- in a separate bowl, whisk together egg, milk and vanilla extract
- add the egg mixture to banana mixture
- sift in flour and baking power, gradually mix into a batter
- fill each cupcake case to about 2/3 full
- bake for 15-20 minutes until risen and test with a skewer
- transfer to a wire cooling rack
- optionally, serve with [[cream-cheese-frosting]]
