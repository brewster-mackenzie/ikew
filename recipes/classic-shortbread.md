Shortbread evolved from medieval biscuit bread, where leftover bread dough was baked as the oven lost its heat. In time, yeast was replaced by butter, and biscuit bread became shortbread

**Preparation time:**  15 mins

**Cooking time:** 55-60 mins

## Ingredients

- 250g very soft butter, plus extra for greasing
- 125g golden caster sugar, plus extra for sprinkling
- 300g plain flour
- 50g cornflour
- ½ tsp fine sea salt

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 170°C, fan 150°C, gas 31⁄2. Grease a 20cm square baking tin and line the base and sides with baking paper.
1. Put the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl and cream together with a wooden spoon until well softened.
1. Tip in both the flours plus the salt and stir until well combined, taking care not to overwork the dough. Bring the dough together with your hands and press the mixture into the prepared tin. Lay a sheet of baking paper or clingfilm on top then flatten the surface of the shortbread using a spatula or the back of a spoon. Discard the covering and prick the top decoratively with a fork.
1. Bake for 55-60 minutes until pale golden. Remove from the oven and sprinkle evenly with extra sugar. Leave to cool in the tin and once fully cooled, cut the shortbread into 16 fingers.

Notes:
The shortbread will keep in an airtight container for up to 5 days, or freezes well.
