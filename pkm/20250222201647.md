Popularized by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. Many individual notes are used to capture ideas as they occur, along with metadata to give them relevance in the wider context of a topic or discussion.  Luhmann used a slip-box (or [[20250222202427]]) with each slip containing a single note.

The Zettelkasten method centres around three types of notes:

3. [[20250222202555]]
