# Literature notes 

Literature notes in the [[zettelkasten]] combine ideas from your [[source-notes-in-the-zettelkasten-method-of-note-taking]] in such a way that you can revisit them later and fully understand them without the need to refer to the source material.

As an example, if you are researching the topic "Baking a chocolate cake" and you use three different source materials, you would take relevant quotes from the sources into separate [[reference-notes]] for each source, then combine what you have learned from these sources into a single literature note, written in your own words, with links back to the original source.
