# Literature notes 

Literature notes in the [[20250222202427]] combine ideas from your [[20250222202145]] in such a way that you can revisit them later and fully understand them without the need to refer to the source material.

As an example, if you are researching the topic "Baking a chocolate cake" and you use three different source materials, you would take relevant quotes from the sources into separate [[20250222220436]] for each source, then combine what you have learned from these sources into a single literature note, written in your own words, with links back to the original source.
