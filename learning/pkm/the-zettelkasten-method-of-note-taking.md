#zettelkasten #pkm

-----

Popularized by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. Many individual notes are used to capture ideas as they occur, along with metadata to give them relevance in the wider context of a topic or discussion.  Luhmann used a slip-box (or [[zettelkasten]]) with each slip containing a single note.

The Zettelkasten method centres around three types of notes:

1. [[fleeting-notes]]  
2. [[source-notes]]
3. [[permanent-notes]]

With the optional use of:

- [[index-notes]]
