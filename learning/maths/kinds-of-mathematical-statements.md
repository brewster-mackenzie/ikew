# Kinds of mathematical statements

Three important kinds of statements in mathematics:

1. A universal statement is true for all elements in a set,
e.g. "all positive numbers are greater than zero"
1. A conditional statement is true when something else is also true,
e.g. "if 200 is greater than 100, then 200 is greater than 99"
1. An existential statement is true for at least one thing where a
property could be true or false, e.g. "there is a prime number that is even"


Statements can be combined:

1. Universal conditional statements - for every fruit *a*,
if *a* is a blueberry, then *a* is a berry.
1. Universal existential statements - for every *a* there exists *b*, e.g.
for every positive integer there exists an additive inverse
1. Existential universal statements - there exists an *a* which satisfies 
a universal statement, e.g. there is a positive integer *a* that is less than
or equal to every positive integer
