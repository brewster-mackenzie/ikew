----- 

The word *set* as a formal mathematical term was first
introduced in 1879 by Georg Cantor (1845-1918)

For most purposes, a set is a collection of elements.

If _C_ is a collection of all counties in the United Kingdom, then
_Lincolnshire_ is an element of _C_.



## Set Notation

To show that *x* is an element of *S*: 

$$x \in S$$

> [!tip] MathJax: `$$x \in S$$`

To show that *x* is not an element of *S*:

$$x \notin S$$

> [!tip] MathJax: `$$x \notin S$$`

### Set-Roster Notation

To denote a set whose elements are *1, 2, and 3*:

$$\lbrace 1,2,3 \rbrace$$

> [!tip] MathJax: `$$\lbrace 1,2,3 \rbrace$$`

To denote a set whose elements are in a range of *1 to 100*:

$$\lbrace 1,2,3...,100 \rbrace$$

> [!tip] MathJax: `$$\lbrace 1,2,3...,100 \rbrace$$`

To denote an infinite set of positive integers:

$$\lbrace 1,2,3... \rbrace$$

> [!tip] MathJax: `$$\lbrace 1,2,3... \rbrace$$`o

## Axiom of extension

The **axiom of extension** says that the elements of a set completely
define that set, not the order in which the elements are listed or 
multiple occurrences of the same element.

Therefore the 3 sets denoted below (*A*, *B* and *C*) are different ways 
to represent the same set:

$$A = \lbrace 1,2,3 \rbrace$$

$$B = \lbrace 2,3,1 \rbrace$$ 

$$C = \lbrace 1,1,2,3,3,3 \rbrace$$


## Frequently used sets

Some sets are common enough to have special symbolic names.

| Symbol | Set |
| ------ | --- |
| $$R$$ | the set of all real numbers |
| $$Z$$ | the set of all integers |
| $$Q$$ | the set of all rational numbers, or quotients of integers |
