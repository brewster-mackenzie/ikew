## Ordered pairs

A stumbling block in the adoption of sets during the late nineteenth century
was how to define an ordered pair, since the defintion of a set is 
not affected by the order of its elements.

That is to say that these two sets are the same:

$\{a, b\}$ and $\{b, a\}$

In 1914 definitions were put forward by Norbert Weiner (1894-1964) and 
Felix Hausdorff (1868-1942), but both definitions were awkward.

In 1921 the Polish mathematician Kazimierz Kuratowsky (1896-1980) published
the following definition, which has since become standard:

$\{\{a\}, \{a, b\}\}$

But, since this is rather cumbersome, the usual notation for ordered pairs 
would refer to this simply as $(a, b)$.

Ordered pairs are equal if the first elements of each set are equal and 
the second elements of each set are equal, in other words:

$(a, b) = (c, d)$ only if $a = c$ and $b = d$

## Ordered n-tuples

Generalised ordered pair notation denoting a set with any finite number
of elements, taking order and multiplicity into account.

The ordered n-tuple $(x_1,x_2...,x_n)$ consists of the elements 
$x_1, x_2..., x_3$ in the order written.

An ordered n-tuple of two elements is called an ordered pair.

An ordered n-tuple of three elements is called an ordered triple.

Ordered n-tuples are equal only if all elements of each set are equal 
and in the same order.
