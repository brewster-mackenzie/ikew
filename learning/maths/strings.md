Given a finite set $A$, a string of length $n$ over $A$ is an ordered
n-tuple of elements of $A$ written without parentheses or commas.

The elements of $A$ are called the *characters* of the string.

A null string over $A$ is defined to be a string with no characters.

A null string is denoted as $\lambda$ and is said to have length 0.

A string over $A = \{0, 1\}$ is called a *bit string*.

For example, all strings of length 3 over $A$ with at least two of the 
same characters:

$$aab, aba, baa, aaa, bba, bab, abb, bbb$$
