# Source notes

Source notes in the   exist to capture information and ideas in real-time.

They are the first step in compiling a [[zettelkasten]] and can be roughly divided into two categories:

- [[fleeting-notes]] for ideas or thoughts that were own and that I don't want to forget
- [[reference-notes]] for ideas taken from an external reference, such as a book, website or paper.
