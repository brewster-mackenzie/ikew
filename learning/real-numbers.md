A real number is a number that can be used to measure a continuous
one-dimensional quantity

- distance
- duration
- temperature, etc.

Every real number can be represented by an infinite decimal expansion.

A real number is any point on a line where the points corresponding
to integers are equally spaced 

$$(...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...)$$

Real numbers include **rational numbers**, e.g. *-17* or *3/5*

And **irrational numbers**, e.g. *\sqrt 2*

The real numbers form an ordered field.  The methods of elementary arithetic apply to them.
